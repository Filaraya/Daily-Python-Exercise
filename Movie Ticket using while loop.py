Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age .
If a person is under the age of 5, the ticket is free;
if they are between 5 and 10, the ticket is $25;
and if they are over age 10, the ticket is $50 .
Write a loop in which you ask users their age,
and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket .
